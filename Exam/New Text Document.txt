clear
for arg in "$@"; do
  input=$arg
  if [ -f $input ];then
    echo "Content is:"
    cat $input
    echo
    echo "Number of characters:"
    wc -m $input
    echo "Number of words:"
    wc -w $input
    echo "Number of lines:"
    wc -l $input
    if [ -r $input ];then
      echo "$input has read permission for currently logged in user"
    elif [ -w $input ];then
      echo "$input has a write permission for currently logged in user"
    elif [ -x $input ];then
      echo "$input has execute permission for currently logged in user"
    fi
    chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r $input
  else
    echo "$input is directory"
  fi
done

b) Write a shell script to collect n number of years from command line argument and calculates
which years are leap years.

clear
for arg in "$@";do
  y=$arg
  y1=`expr $y % 4`
  y2=`expr $y % 100`
  y3=`expr $y % 400`
  if [ $y3 == 0 ]
  then 
    echo "$y is leap year"
  elif [ $y2 == 0 ]
    then 
      echo "$y is not leap year"
  elif [ $y1 == 0 ]
  then 
    echo "$y is leap year"
  else
    echo "$y is not leap year"
  fi
done

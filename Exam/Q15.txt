15. a) Write a shell script which receives any number of filenames as argument. The shell script
should check whether every argument supplies are a file or a directory.
i) If it is a directory then it should be appropriately reported.
ii) if it is a file name then name of the file as well as the no. of lines present in it should be
reported.
iii) Check the file permission for you. If you have no write permission then gives the write
permission.


if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "No arguments specified"
	exit
fi
for i in $*
do
	if [ -f $i ]; then
		echo "$i is  a file"
		echo "Lines: $(cat $i | wc -l)"
		echo "Words: $(cat $i | wc -w)"
		echo "Chars: $(cat $i | wc -c)"

		if [ ! -w $i ]; then
			chmod "g-w" $i
			chmod "o-w" $i
		elif [ ! -x $i ]; then
			chmod "g+x" $i
			chmod "o+x" $i
		else
			ls -l $i | cut -d ' ' -f1
		fi
	else
		echo "$i is a directory"
    a=`dir $i`
    echo $a
	fi
done

b) Write a shell script, which shows all the prime numbers between a lower and upper range


low=1
count=0

while [ $low -eq 1 ]
do
echo "Enter the lower limit,greater than 1"
read low
done

echo "Enter the upper limit"
read upper


for mun in `seq $low $upper`
do
ret=$(factor $mun | grep $mun | cut -d ":" -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 2)

if [ "$ret" -eq "$mun" ] 
then 
echo "$mun is prime" 
((count++))
fi 
done

echo -e "\n There are $count number of prime numbers"
